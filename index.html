  <section class="about" id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I transitioned from marketing into UX and frontend development,
      bringing a deep understanding of users, brands and business.
      I enjoy building calm, clear interfaces — especially for complex systems.
    </p>
     <p>
      I’m a UX Engineer with a background in marketing and frontend development.
      My journey started with understanding people and brands, and evolved into
      designing and building digital systems that balance user needs with
      business goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialise in enterprise platforms, internal tools, and data-heavy
      interfaces — where clarity, structure, and thoughtful UX matter most.
      I enjoy working at the intersection of design and code, translating
      ideas into scalable, usable products.
